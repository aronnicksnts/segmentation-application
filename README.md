# About
This project explores the different ways segmentation could be applied to images. Images to be chosen would vary. Particularly, it would explore the following segmentation techniques:
- Thresholding
- Edge-based Method
- Region Based
- Clustering
- Watershed Method
- PDE Based

Images to be used for the segmentation would be the MURA dataset which contains different radiographs of the upper extremity bones.

Python would be used as the language for the implementation of these segmentation techniques.
