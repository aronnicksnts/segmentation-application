# About
This project explores the different ways segmentation could be applied to images. Images to be chosen would vary. Particularly, it would explore the following segmentation techniques:
- Thresholding
- Edge-based Method
- Region Based
- Clustering
- Watershed Method
- PDE Based

Python would be used as the language for the implementation of these segmentation techniques. 

# Findings
